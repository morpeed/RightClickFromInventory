Allows you to use the right click function of items while held by the mouse.
If you want to drop the item like normal, you can either press the Throw keybind or hold the Auto Select keybind when pressing right click.

Intends to work with all vanilla items and most modded items. If it doesn't function with a modded item, it is probably not my fault.

Additionally comes with a config to enable / disable this feature at will.
